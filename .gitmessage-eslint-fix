fix: resolve ESLint errors in Metronome component

- Replace 'any' type with proper TypeScript intersection type for webkitAudioContext
- Wrap playBeat function with useCallback to satisfy react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
- Update useEffect dependency array to include playBeat

This fixes the following ESLint errors that were causing Vercel deployment to fail:
1. @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any (line 23)
2. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps (line 103)

The metronome functionality remains unchanged and all features work as expected.
